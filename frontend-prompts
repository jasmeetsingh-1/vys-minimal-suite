Your are frontend developer – and also a designer 

your task is to " create a e-commerce website "

We'll be showcasing the prodcuts like the bat and ball – 
`I have provided you the brands book find attached file with the name of the  {VYS Brand book.pdf}
you are pick the color scheme from there and make the design as per it
`
below are the some important details about the desgining which you have to keep in mind:
**always respect these pointers that are given below: <<respect this while making the design>> **
``pointer starting now
1. always reuse the common components. for exmaple: buttons and modal. keep the conistency of the design 
2. buttons must be not border; use border-radius as 0 
3. use the solid colors, *do not use any color gradiants* 
4. keep the design to be minimal, make the design of the website as the minimal - minimalist designs.
``pointers end here 

**Pointers to respect while chossing the color scheme: **
``pointer starting now
1. Keep the shade to the minimal. 
2. I want to use the simple theme of black and white – use the shade of color matching with the brands stand point provided in the {VYS Brand book.pdf}
3. Buttons must have the animation on the hover, that they come out on the hover giving feels like they are 3D
``pointers end here 

Now moving forward I will explain the requirement of the website. what pages you need to make 
<<While making these make sure, you make the one page as the oen component (make the folder of the component and further into it divide the component into smaller parts )>>

``now below I explain the components name <I will provide you with the folder name and further file name>
1. : folder name ~Login~ 
    files within it : `LoginSignUpPage.jsx` -> `Login.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx`
    `LoginSignUpPage.jsx`: this file will have the logic of what page is open -> add the state here to show the `Login.jsx` or `SignUpjsx`
    `Login.jsx` : will have all the required things of the login 
        Login requirement : 
        1. email fields (add the basic email validation) and password field ( provide the feature to see and hide password )
        2. button: "Login"
        3. add another button : "Not an user, signup " -> on this switch to `SignUp.jsx` - from the `LoginSignUpPage.jsx`
        4. add another button of the reset password, {{keep this as the sample for now -> this will be developed in the later stage }}
    `signup.jsx` : will have all the required things of the signup 
        Signup requirement : 
        1. email fields (add the basic email validation) 
        2. password and confirm password  field ( provide the feature to see and hide password on the password field not the confirm password ) - both passwords must match 
        2. button: "Signup"
        3. add another button : "Already an user, login " -> on this switch to `Login.jsx` - from the `LoginSignUpPage.jsx`
<<Next after login component will be explained later on>>

<<SOME IMPORTANT POINTERS FOR THE DEVEOPMENT>>
** Strictly follow these **
1. you can keep the context file for yourself , so that you can use that to do the things -> always use that to understand what was going on and upto what is developed – store all the theme details into it and also keep in that files things that be used resubale.

2. Keep the code to the minimal , 
3. Make sure you dont wrap the unneccessary too many divs aroudn the component 
4. for layout, use the `display: flex` 
5. keep the code human readable

---Second prompt <START>----

Here are the some important things that you need to keep in mind while developing things ahead 
update context file to use REACT BOOTSTRAP MODAL  - to implements modal thought out the project

``important pointers start 
<<Always remember this && and respect this>>

1. Keep the context file always updated, make sure you add all the said implementation steps or the rules that are being explained in the given prompt. 
2. Always read the context before implementing new things and respect the rules. 
3. In context file make a session that store all the resubale things details and use them where ever required while developing 

``important pointers end 

Now lets implement a new things : implementing **Reset password functionality**

1. Remove the coming soon from the reset 

Reset functionality flow: 
``Explaining functionality 
1. On clicking user see the modal that ask them to enter the email 
  modal file `resetModal.jsx` -> details explained below
2. We will  iniate a email (need not to worry for this now -> this will be implemented in the later stage) 
3. From the email user will be navigated to the `http://localhost:8081/auth/resetPassword?userID=12345&email=johndoe@example.com&token=abc123xyz` on the </resetPassword> we will open `resetPage.jsx` -> page details explained below



``now below I explain the components name <I will provide you with the folder name and further file name>
1. : folder name ~resetPassword~ 
    files within it : `resetModal.jsx` 
    another file : `resetPage.jsx`

explaining the `resetModal.jsx` 
- in this file implement the modal using {REACT BOOTSTRAP MODAL} 
- fields in modal : email -> hit the api `/vys/auth/check-email` to check if user exist 
  if(userExist) -> enable the "Get Reset Link"
  if we dont have the user -> show to use that no user found with the email 

<<Later we will add the api which send the email, once we have that then we will show the progress with changing button to "sending email" button will be disabled until loading and once that api success we will show message "Link send successfully, check your email " for now implement this functionality wiht dummy timer *update context file under the pending items * >>

--- resetModal.jsx explanation end ----

explaining the `resetPage.jsx`

this page will open when on {http://localhost:8081/auth/resetPassword?userID=12345&email=johndoe@example.com&token=abc123xyz}
Read the values from the userID, adn email and token from query params 

UI requirments for this page: 
1. new Password and confirm password field ( provide the feature to see and hide password )
2. show the email fetched from teh query params but that would not be edittable <only show the email, UI not as it is the field rather as it is simply the text>
3. Button "Reset password" -> this initate the API `/auth/reset-password`
