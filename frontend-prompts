Your are frontend developer – and also a designer 

your task is to " create a e-commerce website "

We'll be showcasing the prodcuts like the bat and ball – 
`I have provided you the brands book find attached file with the name of the  {VYS Brand book.pdf}
you are pick the color scheme from there and make the design as per it
`
below are the some important details about the desgining which you have to keep in mind:
**always respect these pointers that are given below: <<respect this while making the design>> **
``pointer starting now
1. always reuse the common components. for exmaple: buttons and modal. keep the conistency of the design 
2. buttons must be not border; use border-radius as 0 
3. use the solid colors, *do not use any color gradiants* 
4. keep the design to be minimal, make the design of the website as the minimal - minimalist designs.
``pointers end here 

**Pointers to respect while chossing the color scheme: **
``pointer starting now
1. Keep the shade to the minimal. 
2. I want to use the simple theme of black and white – use the shade of color matching with the brands stand point provided in the {VYS Brand book.pdf}
3. Buttons must have the animation on the hover, that they come out on the hover giving feels like they are 3D
``pointers end here 

Now moving forward I will explain the requirement of the website. what pages you need to make 
<<While making these make sure, you make the one page as the oen component (make the folder of the component and further into it divide the component into smaller parts )>>

``now below I explain the components name <I will provide you with the folder name and further file name>
1. : folder name ~Login~ 
    files within it : `LoginSignUpPage.jsx` -> `Login.jsx` and `SignUp.jsx`
    `LoginSignUpPage.jsx`: this file will have the logic of what page is open -> add the state here to show the `Login.jsx` or `SignUpjsx`
    `Login.jsx` : will have all the required things of the login 
        Login requirement : 
        1. email fields (add the basic email validation) and password field ( provide the feature to see and hide password )
        2. button: "Login"
        3. add another button : "Not an user, signup " -> on this switch to `SignUp.jsx` - from the `LoginSignUpPage.jsx`
        4. add another button of the reset password, {{keep this as the sample for now -> this will be developed in the later stage }}
    `signup.jsx` : will have all the required things of the signup 
        Signup requirement : 
        1. email fields (add the basic email validation) 
        2. password and confirm password  field ( provide the feature to see and hide password on the password field not the confirm password ) - both passwords must match 
        2. button: "Signup"
        3. add another button : "Already an user, login " -> on this switch to `Login.jsx` - from the `LoginSignUpPage.jsx`
<<Next after login component will be explained later on>>

<<SOME IMPORTANT POINTERS FOR THE DEVEOPMENT>>
** Strictly follow these **
1. you can keep the context file for yourself , so that you can use that to do the things -> always use that to understand what was going on and upto what is developed – store all the theme details into it and also keep in that files things that be used resubale.

2. Keep the code to the minimal , 
3. Make sure you dont wrap the unneccessary too many divs aroudn the component 
4. for layout, use the `display: flex` 
5. keep the code human readable
